It is verry likely that you'll have to make changes in the code to make it work for your hardware and needs.
For example:
- Screen and Preview resolution
  - Font size
- Default settings
- Hardware integration:
  - GPIO Pins
    - Shutter button
    - Navigation buttons
  - Code for Battery level
  - Code for RTC
